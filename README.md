# Segmented Array

This crate contains an implmentation of a segmented array, as described in this [blog post](https://danielchasehooper.com/posts/segment_array/):

> A data structure with constant time indexing, stable pointers, and works well
> with arena allocators. ... The idea is straight forward: the structure
> contains a fixed sized array of pointers to segments. Each segment is twice
> the size of its predecessor. New segments are allocated as needed. ... Unlike
> standard arrays, pointers to a segment arrayâ€™s items are always valid because
> items are never moved. Leaving items in place also means it never leaves
> "holes" of abandoned memory in arena allocators. The layout also allows us to
> access any index in constant time.

In terms of this Rust implementation, rather than stable "pointers", the references returned from `SegmentedArray::get()` will be stable. The behavior, memory layout, and performance of this implementation should be identical to that of the C implementation.

This data structure is meant to hold an unknown, though likely large, number of elements, otherwise `Vec` would be more appropriate. An empty array will have a hefty size of around 224 bytes.
