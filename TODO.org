* Segmented Array
** prototype
*** DONE implement =Drop= to dealloc the segments
*** DONE test outputs malloc/free error; maybe fixed
**** the =test_add_get_several= test fails >50% of runs
**** error output from =cargo test=
#+begin_src
malloc: *** error for object 0x6000011e4220: pointer being freed was not allocated
#+end_src
**** probably because the =String= is allocated and moves vs u64 which copies
*** DONE add test that uses a small struct vs a string (i.e. stack vs heap)
*** DONE write a test that allocates an array, fills it with many items, drops it, and repeat numerous times
*** DONE use =ulid= to generate many random strings for an example
*** TODO use the =ulid= example to run ASAN or similar to detect leaks
*** TODO make sure =.iter().collect()= can be used to create an array
*** TODO determine which traits it should implement
- Iter
- IntoIter
- directly reference elements
*** DONE reduce unwrap() and expect() usage if appropriate
** testing
*** benchmarks
**** TODO compare to =Vec=
**** TODO compare to =HashSet=
**** TODO compare to =BTreeSet=
